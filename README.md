# Multiplicity of Visualization and Reporting Strategies Impact on the Results Interpretation
In order to take a closer look at multiplicity within individual papers due to the replication crisis in science, it was considered here how many different possibilities there are to represent a graph. This was done in the context of a Master's thesis at the LMU (Ludwig-Maximilians Universit√§t in Munich, Germany) at the Institute for Statistics. This repository was created for public access to all data.  

In order to tackle multiplicity with a suitable example, the freely accessible paper "Large-scale benchmark study of survival prediction methods using multi-omics data" (https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa167) was used, the public data can be found here https://github.com/HerrMo/multi-omics_benchmark_study.
